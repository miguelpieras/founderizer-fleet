"""Is this machine of a fleet healthy? The one check that PRODUCT.md 4.1 freezes, as `fleet.py verify`.

    python3 fleet.py verify           one readable line for each check, then READY
    python3 fleet.py verify --json    the array of 4.1 and nothing else

Each check answers {"check", "state": ok|warn|fail, "says", "fix"}, with the ids of CHECKS and nothing else, and
"command" when its fix has one. `says` and `fix` are the owner's words, because the app shows them: no file name,
path, command or internal id, "server" and never "machine", agents by the names both apps give them. The exact
command is apart, in "command": the readable form prints it in a terminal as (run: ...), and the app shows it nowhere
but gives it to an agent, in the prompt that Report a problem copies. An answer without one has the four fields alone.

A check that does not apply to this machine is absent from the array: a worker has no hub_answers and no
owner_claimed. An agent of this machine that a check does not read is named in it and warns - one team.json
keeps inactive until the owner has signed it in and activated it, and one the hub answers for that this
checkout does not name yet - because a machine never answers for its own agents in silence. Nothing failing
means READY and exit 0, because a warn is not a failure; else the failing ids and exit 1.

One check reads a file and not the machine: `team` runs the rules of hub.validate_team over this checkout's
team.json, because a hub starts on a file that does not validate and nothing else on a machine says so.

It changes nothing, ever: every command it runs reads, and it needs no root. It runs on Linux and on macOS, and
reads the places the helper's own status reading reads (lifecycle.Lifecycle.security and .runtime), so the two
never disagree - and on a Mac, where the runtime's credential is in the login Keychain and only the login session
opens it, `runtime_signed_in` is that helper's own reading (signed_in). On Linux each agent's session runs as its
own OS user, so the three checks that read a user -
services, runtime_installed and runtime_signed_in - are taken as that agent's user, and a reading this command
cannot take is named and warns, never passes (PRODUCT.md 4.1). Three lanes read this shape: the installers end with it, the app shows it as the owner's
checklist, and the support duty runs it from a heartbeat.

The recorded pilot case checker, which held this name until 2026-10-17, is verify_case.py.
