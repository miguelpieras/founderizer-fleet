"""Fleet vault broker for a Linux worker: the store's key and the handover key belong to the vault, not to agents.

The broker runs as its own user (for example fleet-vault). Only that user can read the key of the fleet's own store
(or the Bitwarden access token) and the age key that opens sealed handovers. Agents run as the worker's user, so they can read neither, and no operation of
the broker gives them a login: it answers with an outcome, or with a handover that only the receiving machine's
broker can open. The helper sends only a job number; the broker takes the login, the receiving agent and that
agent's pinned handover key from the hub's confirmation of the job, never from the request.

A broker opens its logins from one of two stores, which its configuration chooses:

  - **the fleet's own store** (store, store_key): one age-encrypted file on this machine. No Bitwarden account, no
    organization and no network. The owner puts a login in it with  store-put  and sees its names with  store-list ;
    store-init  makes the key and the empty store. The key is an age identity in the broker's state folder, mode 600,
    which only the vault user can read; an agent never reads the store, the key or a value.
  - **a Bitwarden Secrets Manager project** (region, token_file, bws, bws_config): what the pilot used, unchanged.

The operation set is the same for both, and so is every answer: an outcome, or a copy that only the receiving
machine's broker can open. A fresh fleet needs no Bitwarden account; a fleet that has one keeps it.

A broker belongs to a machine and not to one agent: `worker_group` is the group of that machine's agent users, so an
agent the owner adds later, or one whose OS user changed, reaches it with no change to its configuration. Such a
broker has no `agent` of its own and every request to it names its caller, which is how it can be installed with the
machine, before it has its first agent (`hubsetup.vault_install`). `worker_uid`, one user, is the form of a machine
that ran one agent, and it still works.

A Linux broker does handovers. Signing in needs a browser, so it is the Mac vault helper's work (same protocol).

A Linux broker also makes a new login for a confirmed job (create_login): it makes the password, keeps a record
before its one create call, and answers with the login's name. With the fleet's own store it needs nothing more,
because that store writes itself. With a Bitwarden project it needs the write setup, which uses the pinned Bitwarden
SDK library in the broker's own process, because the Bitwarden program takes a new value as a command argument;
without that setup such a broker only reads, as before.

With a curl program in its configuration, a Linux broker also sends one HTTP request for a confirmed job (call_api):
to the origin of the saved login and with its key, which stays in the broker. It keeps the identity of each request
that it started, so the same request is never sent again, and a cancel ends the requests of one task attempt.
Without that key the broker sends no request.

A Linux broker also gives a session start the API keys that the owner lets the calling agent read (read): the hub
names them, and the broker reads each value and registers its fingerprints before it gives it to the worker's user.

With the fleet's own store, a Linux broker also takes a key or a login that the owner typed into Founderizer on his
Mac (deposit): the app seals the value to this broker's pinned key, the hub carries the sealed copy, and the broker
opens it, has the hub compare the value's fingerprints with the owner's, and saves it under the same reference.

With the fleet's own store, a Linux broker also gives such a delivered secret back (withdraw) when no agent of its
machine holds it any more: the hub names the reference for one confirmed job, and the broker removes the item only when
its store says that the owner's vault delivered it, never a login that the owner saved there himself or that this
vault made.

With an ssh program in its configuration, a Linux broker also writes one stored key into a target that the owner
defined (place): an application's .env file or a Kubernetes Secret on another host. It connects with its own SSH key,
which it makes once in its state folder and which the target host allows only the place helper (place.py), checks the
host key that the owner pinned, and sends the value on that connection's standard input. The helper answers with a
salted fingerprint of what it reads back, which the broker and then the hub compare with the value's own. The hub names
the key, the variable and the target for one confirmed job; the broker takes nothing of that from its caller.

With `"central": true` in its configuration, the same program is the fleet's **central vault** on the hub's server:
one store that holds every secret of the fleet, which answers only the hub's user, never calls the hub and needs no
network. It takes a value that the owner sealed to its key in his app (intake), and it seals a copy of a value only to
a machine key that the owner signed (pin, unpin, seal), and its backup only to a recovery key that the owner signed
(recovery, export). The owner signs with an ECDSA P-256 key of his Mac and the vault verifies every statement itself,
so a hub that is broken into cannot add a machine of its own and pull every secret in one call. It runs as its own
user (CENTRAL_UNIT), and only root installs or updates it (`hubsetup.py central-vault`): no release reaches it.

Run a copy that the worker's user cannot change (root-owned, outside the worker's checkout), with a root-owned
configuration, Bitwarden settings and programs, because an agent can change every file in its own checkout:
    python3 /usr/local/lib/fleet-vault/vault.py serve --config /etc/fleet-vault/vault.json
    python3 vault.py unit --config /etc/fleet-vault/vault.json --user fleet-vault --group <worker group>
    python3 /usr/local/lib/fleet-vault/vault.py store-init --config /etc/fleet-vault/vault.json \\
        --user fleet-vault                                       (as root; the fleet's own store, safe to run again)
    sudo -u fleet-vault python3 /usr/local/lib/fleet-vault/vault.py store-put --config /etc/fleet-vault/vault.json \\
        --title "<name>" < login.json                            (the owner's own login; the value on standard input)
    python3 /usr/local/lib/fleet-vault/vault.py sdk-install --config /etc/fleet-vault/vault.json \\
        --manifest <folder>/vault-sdk.json --project <Bitwarden project UUID>   (as root; Bitwarden's write setup)
    python3 vault.py unit --central --config /etc/fleet-vault-central/vault.json --group <the hub user's group>
Protocol 2: one JSON line in, one JSON line out, on a Unix socket. See UI-API.md, "Vault isolation (V3)", and for the
central vault "the central vault (central_vault)".

"""
# This is the one Fleet file that a release never delivers. The broker runs a root-owned copy at
# /usr/local/lib/fleet-vault/vault.py, outside every checkout a helper updates, and `lifecycle.OWNER_ONLY` lists
# this file among the ones a helper never loads -- so a commit that changes only this file advances the revision
# every machine reports and reaches no broker. Each machine brings its own copy across instead: its server service
# compares the installed program with the vault.py of its checkout and, where they differ, runs the one root
# command the installers put there, /usr/local/sbin/fleet-vault-program (server.Service.vault_program,
# hubsetup.vault_program_script). A broker that does not come up on a new program gets back the one that was
# serving, and a broker still behind ten minutes later is what the hub's `vault_behind` warning is for.
#
# So **changing this file is the only thing that exercises that path**, and on 23 October 2026 it had never run:
# over the whole retained journal of both Linux hosts, `journalctl _UID=$(id -u fleet)` held no line "brought this
# machine's vault broker onto", and eight of "could not bring" -- the command was missing until that morning, and
# the brokers were then caught up by hand. This comment is the change that tests it for the first time.
