"""The Fleet server service (owner feature servers): one on each server that joined with a join code, as the OS user of
its agents (fleet on Linux, the Mac user on a Mac). Standard library only.

    python3 server.py join --hub URL --kind linux|mac [--ssh-port N]    once, from the join line (join.sh); the join
                                                                        code comes on standard input
    python3 server.py service                                           write and start this server's service again
    python3 server.py run                                               the service

The service sends the server's reading every five minutes, takes the server's jobs from the hub and updates its own
checkout when it has no job. With no job it also brings this machine's vault broker onto the vault.py of that
checkout, through the second root command the installers put in place (hubsetup.vault_program_script): a release
reaches every checkout here and never the broker's root-owned copy, so without that step a release that changed
vault.py left the broker behind while this machine reported the new revision.

Three job kinds. install: an agent. Its steps on Linux: the agent's own OS user fleet-<agent>, then its
runtime, its checkout ~fleet-<agent>/fleet-<agent>, its service and the runtime's sign-in
when that user is not signed in (Codex: a link and a code in Fleet; Claude Code: the sign-in that the hub drives for
that agent, machine_signin, which the owner finishes in the app and never in a terminal). Everything of one agent is
in that user's home at mode 700, so no other agent of the machine can read its runtime credential or its vault token. This service has no root, so the user is made by the one root command the
installers put in place (/usr/local/sbin/fleet-agent-user, hubsetup.agent_helper) and the rest is run as that user
through the one sudoers line beside it. A Mac keeps one user for its agents (PRODUCT.md P2), and so does an agent
from before the move: there every step is this service's own user, as it was. prepare: the other runtime of an agent
on this server, before the owner switches it, with the same runtime and sign-in steps, under that agent's own user;
it changes no agent, checkout or service. rename: an agent the owner gave a new name (agent_rename): its checkout
and its service move to the new name under the OS user it already has, so it keeps its runtime and its sign-in. The
service runs no AI session and reads no secret. Its key is
~/.fleet/server.key (mode 600); the hub keeps only its SHA-256, and it opens only this server's routes.

        broker: it runs a root-owned copy of vault.py outside all of them as a system service, and a helper never
        loads that file (lifecycle.OWNER_ONLY), so a commit that changes only it advances the revision this

        before it while the Updates page said the fleet was current, and the owner pasted one root command per
        machine after every such release. This is that catch-up, done by the machine that needs it.

        **The gate is a reading and needs no root.** The installed program is root-owned and world-readable, so
        this service hashes it and this checkout's vault.py itself and asks for nothing while they agree. Where
        they differ it asks, and root fetches the bytes from the configuration ref itself: this service passes no
        bytes, no path and no revision, so a wrong reading here can only cost root one fetch that finds nothing to
        do. A try that did not settle it -- no network, or a broker that did not come up and kept the program that
