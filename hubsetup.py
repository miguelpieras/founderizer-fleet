                                                    and the handover key, so no agent of the machine can read either

                                                    the end checks on this machine: selftest.py and GET /health
    python3 hubsetup.py fleet-id [--db PATH]        this fleet's own id in the hub's key store, made once

Why the claim exists. The owner is a Tailscale address and no token (hub.py `allowed("owner")`), so a hub with the
wrong `addresses.owner` serves the owner's pages to the wrong machine, and one with none serves them to nobody. The
installer therefore proves the address before it finishes, with the same one-time code that join.sh uses, the other
way round: this machine makes the code, the owner's Mac sends it back, and the address of that call is the owner.

The claim listener holds the hub's own address and port, so the Tailscale access rules for port 8765 are proved
before the hub exists. It keeps only the code's SHA-256, never writes the code anywhere, takes one code once, and
stops as soon as it has the address. The script it serves at GET /claim then waits for the hub itself on the same
port and prints the line for the app's Settings, so the final check is made from the owner's own machine.

This program never signs in to Claude, Codex or Grok, never reads or writes a provider credential, and never makes
a vault entry. The customer signs in to their own account in their own session; `"vault": "none"` in the template
says that the manager holds no credential of ours.

def vault_program_script(repo, branch=lifecycle.CONFIG_BRANCH):
    """The second root command of this machine: `/usr/local/sbin/fleet-vault-program` brings the vault broker onto
    the `vault.py` of the fleet's configuration ref, and does nothing else. It takes no argument at all.

    **Why it exists.** A release updates every checkout on a machine and never the broker, which runs a root-owned
    copy of `vault.py` outside all of them as a system service, and `lifecycle.OWNER_ONLY` lets a commit that
    changes only that file count as taken. So a release that changed `vault.py` left every broker running the copy
    installed before it while each machine reported `current`, and the owner pasted one root command per machine to
    catch them up -- for ever, and from memory. Measured on 22 October 2026: two releases of one day changed
    `vault.py`, nobody in the fleet had cut either of them, both left every Linux broker behind, both brokers were
    brought level by hand that afternoon, and in between both lacked the `deposit` operation those releases
    shipped. What the hand route pastes is this command's own reason for existing: it installs `vault.py` from an
    agent's checkout, which that agent owns and can write, so automating it this way is narrower than the line it
    replaces and not wider.

    **What the service user gains, exactly.** It can ask root to replace the broker's program with the `vault.py`
    on the fleet's configuration ref and restart the broker. It cannot name the file, the source, the destination,
    the revision or the service, and it passes no bytes: the bytes are fetched here, as root, from the address this
    machine already takes all of its code from, into a bare repository that only root can write. So this adds no
    trust -- the fleet's code reaches this machine from that ref either way -- and it removes the hop the pasted
    command had through a checkout a user can write. Nothing else of the broker is touched: its user, its store,
    its store key and its handover key are never read here, and the handover key is never remade, because a new one
    would turn every agent's access into `vault_store_mismatch`.

    Nothing is fetched into a working tree and nothing of the fetched repository is ever run: the program is read
    out of the fetch with `git cat-file`, so no hook, filter or submodule of it executes as root.

    **A broker that does not come up keeps the program that was serving.** This runs unattended after a release, and
    an installed broker that is not serving means no agent of that machine can use a secret it holds. So the copy
    that was serving goes back, and the hub's own `vault_behind` warning is then the one that says this machine
    needs a person -- which is what that warning is for.

    `repo` is the address of the fleet's configuration ref, as the hub serves it to this machine. Without one the
    command refuses and says to run the join line again, because a source read from anywhere else on this machine
    is a source somebody else can write."""
