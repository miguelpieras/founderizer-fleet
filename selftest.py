# ---------------------------------------------------------------- every tool is named where an agent reads it
# The two checks above prove that RULES.md names every tool. That is the catalog test, and it is not enough: an
# agent reads RULES.md once, at the start of a session, before it knows which tool the work will need. In one day
# four capabilities shipped complete, tested and inert -- an agent's own notes, folding duplicate lessons, the whole
# needs_access grant route, and the manager's own reason for a task -- because nothing in an agent's own path ever
# named them. Each was found by a person noticing, which is not a process.
#
# So the stronger rule: every tool is named somewhere an agent is read to IN THE MOMENT it would reach for it. In
# this codebase that corpus is the hub's own prose -- a session's start text, the details the hub writes into a
# task, what a tool answers, a refusal, a [hub] message, a wake-up's words -- which is the string literals of
# hub.py and wakeups.py, plus one real start text read off a running hub below.
#
# What does not count, and why:
#   * a tool's own description in TOOLS and wakeups.TOOL_SPECS: that is the catalog again, the thing under test. A
#     tool only a conscientious agent finds there is a tool that ships inert, and "conscientious under pressure" is
#     not a design.
#   * RULES.md and profiles/: RULES.md is the check above, and a profile is the owner's own prose, which the fleet's
#     code can neither rely on nor keep current.
#   * docstrings: notes to whoever reads the code. No session ever sees one.
#   * the hub's own log: the owner reads it; no agent does.
#   * SQL: a column named like a tool says nothing to anybody.
#   * comments: the tree leaves them out by itself, which is the point -- hub.py explains itself in comments that
#     name tools no agent is ever told about, and they must not let a tool pass.

# 0b what a root command of a machine may be given (hubsetup.sudoers_text and the scripts it names)
#
# A machine's service user holds a few rights with root, and each one is meant to be a single mechanical act. The
# privilege in such a right is not the command, it is the argument: a root command that takes a path the caller
# chooses installs whatever that caller wrote, and the caller here is a user that runs the fleet's own code. Both of
# the fleet's instances of that shipped before anybody looked -- the repair line that read vault.py out of an
# agent's own checkout, and a rule naming a command with no argument list, which sudoers reads as "with any
# arguments the caller chooses" (sudoers(5)).
#
# So: every root right either takes no argument at all, or the command it names checks the one argument it takes
# against a closed pattern before it does anything. test_agent_users.Sudoers pins the two rules this fleet has
# today as text; this is the rule for a root right nobody has written yet, and it is here because selftest.py is
# what a release runs -- a lane that adds one fails the release until it has decided whether the caller can steer
# it. Source only: no hub, no network, nothing started, and no file of this machine is read.
#
# A guard that cannot fail is no guard, so each branch below was made to fail once before it shipped, by running
# this block against a mutated `sudoers_text` and mutated scripts: a root command the table does not know, a
# wildcard argument, a rule with no argument list at all (which sudoers reads as "any"), that rule together with a
# script that installs `$1`, a helper with its pattern check deleted, a pattern that matches a path, an effect
# before the check, and a `""` rule whose script no longer refuses an argument. All eight were caught. The last
# two shapes are this fleet's own history: the repair line that read `vault.py` out of an agent's checkout, and
# the rule that named the vault command with no argument list.
