# Put this Fleet checkout on the configuration ref, and create that ref the first time.
#
# The fleet keeps its configuration (team.json, profiles/, knowledge/) on the branch "config" and its code on
# "main". The hub commits the owner's changes to "config" and nothing else writes it, so a developer's push to
# "main" can no longer refuse an owner write with 409. Code reaches the fleet when a deployment merges "main"
# into "config".
#
#   sh config-ref.sh --check [<checkout>]    say what it would do, change nothing
#   sh config-ref.sh [<checkout>]            do it
#
# The first run creates "config" at origin/main's commit, so the tree does not change, no history is lost and no
# machine turns "behind": every checkout stays at the commit it had. Later runs only move a checkout onto the ref,
# which each helper also does by itself before a task session (lifecycle.follow_config_ref).
