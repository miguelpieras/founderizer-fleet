"""Founderizer helper. One file for every machine, standard library only.

Setting up
  fleet.py addresses vps=<ip> mac-studio=<ip> owner=<ip>
                               write the machines' Tailscale addresses into team.json
  fleet.py connect <agent>     point this machine's CLI at the team tools
  fleet.py check <agent>       is this machine ready?
  fleet.py verify [--json]     is this machine of the fleet healthy? (PRODUCT.md 4.1)

Running
  fleet.py run <agent>         the stand-in helper: one session per task, hub messages typed in,
                               sign-ins and handovers done outside the agent's session
  fleet.py start manager       start the manager session again after it stopped
  fleet.py git-credential get  git's credential helper in a task session with GitHub repositories (the helper sets it)

On your own machine
  fleet.py watch               a notification when something needs you
  fleet.py say "text"          send the manager a message
  fleet.py board               print the board as text
  fleet.py hub                 print the hub's address
  fleet.py register bws://<secret-id> [--site]
                               give the hub the fingerprint of a login, never the login
                               (--site: also let it sign in to the practice site)

Logins, by hand (agents never run these: they ask the helper with the team tools sign_in and hand_over)
  fleet.py signin <login> --agent <agent>
  fleet.py handover --login <login> --to <agent> --agent <agent>
  fleet.py leakcheck <login> [--agent <agent>]    look for that login where it must never be

A login is named  bws://<secret-id>  (kept in Bitwarden Secrets Manager) or  sealed:<number>  (a handover).
This is a throwaway test kit, not the product.

          lost that a read cannot give back: the fleet's state is in the hub, and the brief opens with it.
        - It started without the compaction window (STANDING_COMPACT), before this helper had it: one time.

        A signal that this helper typed less than one cache lifetime ago counts as a model call, so a conversation file
