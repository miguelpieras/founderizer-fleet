# The owner's own MCP server

`owner_mcp.py` is the third face of Founderizer. The first is the Mac app. The second is
`INSTALL-PROMPT.md`, a prompt the customer pastes into the agent they already run. This is the
one that works unattended: **an MCP server that an agent connects to, and then sets a fleet up
and runs it** — it installs a hub, claims it, adds machines and agents, adds MCP servers, hands out
access from the pool, says a goal, reads every check, takes releases and backups, and answers a
Needs-you item.
No person clicks anything.

It is for the owner's own agent: his Claude, or any MCP client. It is not for the fleet's agents —
they have their own server, the `fleet` tools of `hub.py` (RULES.md). This one is the owner's side.
**OWNER-MCP-BOUNDARY.md** is why that sentence holds in the code and not only here: what stops this
server becoming a tool the manager can grant, why nothing refuses it by name, and where the
confirmation of a destructive call goes when there is no window to put it in.

## Give it to an agent

One grant, once. In the agent's MCP configuration, for Claude Code or any client that starts a
local server:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"founderizer": {
  "command": "python3",
  "args": ["/Users/<you>/fleet-pilot/owner_mcp.py"],
  "env": {"FOUNDERIZER_HUB": "http://100.64.0.1:8765"}
}}}
```

`FOUNDERIZER_HUB` can be left out: then the agent calls `use_hub` once with the address, or
`install_hub` and `claim_hub` when there is no hub yet, and the server writes the address into
`~/.founderizer/hub`. That file is the whole of its state, and it is no credential.

Nothing else is needed. There is no token to issue, no key to copy and nothing to rotate.

## How it authenticates to the hub, and why that is the whole of it

**It does not.** The hub knows the owner by the address the call comes from.

`hub.py` `ui_allowed` is the gate on every owner route: the call must come from the address that
`team.json` holds as `addresses.owner`, it must carry **no** bearer token, and it must carry no
browser `Origin`. The Mac app is authorized by exactly that and by nothing else — "The native app
uses the existing owner machine identity." So an MCP server that runs on the owner's Mac inherits
that identity as it stands. It holds no credential of its own, and there is no second credential
path to secure, leak or revoke.

That address is proved once, by the install's **claim** (`hubsetup.py`, "Why the claim exists"):
the installer on the new hub makes a one-time code, the owner's Mac sends it back, and the address
of that call becomes the hub's owner. The server's `claim_hub` tool makes exactly that call —
`POST /claim` with the code in the request body, from this Mac — so the server can take a fleet
from nothing and end up holding the authority, without a second mechanism being invented for it.

What follows from this is the whole security model, and it is the owner's own:

- **The grant is the authorization.** The owner's words, 17 October 2026: "If I grant access to a
  repo/database/system/server is for the relevant agent to take full responsability". So after the
  owner has put this server in his agent's configuration, it acts. It asks for no per-call
  confirmation, and it builds no second approval in front of a hub route.
- **Its authority is what it holds, not what it is told.** It holds the owner's Mac. That is the
  boundary, and it is the same boundary the Mac app has. A prompt, a web page or a machine's log
  cannot widen it: text that comes back from the hub, from an install log or from a server is
  data, and the server never runs any of it.
- **Revoking it is one step, and it is the Mac.** Take the server out of the agent's
  configuration, or change `addresses.owner` on the hub. There is nothing else to withdraw.

Because the address is the credential, the server is only the owner **on the owner's Mac**. On any
other machine every owner route answers 403, and the server says so in those words.

## No secret through a tool

In or out: no password, no API key, no provider token, no entitlement, no Tailscale auth key.
`test_owner_mcp.NoSecret` holds the server to it two ways: no tool takes an argument whose name is
one of those things, and the owner routes that do carry a credential are **not tools of this
server at all** — the subscription token, the GitHub App's private key, a chat bot token, Google's
client secret, the secret catalog's fingerprints and the restore of a copy. Those stay the app's,
because this server would be the thing that carried the value.

Two kinds of short text do pass, and both are allowed by RULES.md, "Logins":

- **The Tailscale auth key is named, never carried.** `install_hub` takes the *path* of a file on
  this Mac, refuses it unless only its owner can read it (mode 600), never opens it in Python, and
  gives it to the server on `ssh`'s standard input, exactly as `INSTALL-PROMPT.md` asks.
- **A one-time code that dies in minutes** — the install's claim code, a machine's join code, the
  device code a provider shows the owner. "A one-time code that dies within minutes is the only
  thing you may pass on as plain text." The hub keeps each of them only as a SHA-256.

## One owner API, not two

Every tool is one route of `hub.py`'s owner API, with that route's own body, its own command rules
and its own refusals:

- a `request_id` of its own on every command, so a lost answer is sent again and lands once (a tool
  takes the owner's agent's own `request_id` for exactly that);
- the hub's generation (`db`) on every read and command, read again once when the hub says it
  moved;
- `base_sha256` of `team.json` on every command that moves it, read from `GET /ui/team`
  immediately before the command, so a change that arrived meanwhile is the hub's own 409 and not
  a silent overwrite;
- the hub's refusal, given back whole — not only the reason but what came with it, because a
  refusal often carries what is still missing, and that is the part the agent must act on.

This file validates nothing the hub validates. It passes the fields through and gives the hub's
own words back, so the two cannot drift apart. It validates only what no hub sees: the SSH host
and user it puts in a command line, and the mode of the auth key file.

`fleet_read` is the reads. Each of its pages is one `GET` route, and
`test_owner_mcp.Shape.test_every_page_of_fleet_read_is_a_get_route_the_hub_really_serves` reads
`hub.py`'s own dispatch to prove it, because a page that named a route the hub does not serve
would read as an empty fleet instead of as a mistake.

## The tools

| `share_resource` / `take_resource` | `/ui/resources`, `/ui/resources/take` | The pool's standing; and end one hold. |
| `save_account` | `/ui/team/accounts` | One runtime account: its provider and the owner's title for it. |
| `save_login` | `/ui/team/logins` | The owner's title for one vault login, by its `bws://` reference. The label only. |
| `machine_access` | `/ui/team/access` | How the fleet reaches a machine: its SSH user, port, Screen Sharing. |

| `send_again` | `/ui/outbound/<id>/again` | Send one chat message again, for an unknown or failed one. |
| `disconnect_google` / `disconnect_mcp_server` | `/ui/google/disconnect`, `/ui/mcp/disconnect` | End a saved connection. The grants stay. |
| `attach_file` / `read_attachment` / `keep_attachment` | `/ui/attachments*` | A file to the hub, a file back to this Mac, and keeping one. |
| `owner_device` / `device_code` | `/ui/owner/devices[/<d>/code]` | The owner's phones, and one enrollment code. Its key is the phone's. |
| `reload_team` | `/ui/team/reload` | Apply `team.json` from a pushed revision without restarting the hub. |
| `send_message` | `/ui/messages` | Say something to an agent. **This is how a goal or a duty is set.** |
| `answer_needs_you` | `/ui/needs/<id>` | Answer a Needs-you item, in words or by choosing an option. A secret request takes neither: the app's secure form answers it. |
| `control_task` / `steer_task` | `/ui/tasks/<id>/control`, `/steer` | Pause, stop, resume; steer an open task. |
| `goal_state` / `duty_state` / `trigger_state` | `/ui/goals/<id>/state` and the two beside it | Pause, resume, finish, drop. |
| `settle_outcome` | `/ui/outcomes/<id>` | Record whether an unknown outcome took effect. |
| `check_releases` / `take_release` / `automatic_releases` | `/ui/releases/*` | Ask the channel; take the release; turn automatic updates off or on (on by default). |
| `take_backup` | `/ui/backup`, `/ui/backups/confirm` | A copy of the fleet into a file on this Mac, checked. |

**A goal and a duty have no form.** UI-API.md version 1.20 took the owner's own writers out of the
hub on the owner's direction: he says in chat what he wants the fleet to reach, and the manager
writes it down with `update_goal`, or a duty with `set_duty`. So this server sets a goal with
`send_message` and nothing else, and `goal_state` and `duty_state` are the state changes that
stayed.

## The three things it cannot do without the owner

Not because a rule forbids it, but because each one is the owner's own hands on something this
server is not allowed to carry.

1. **Bring a new credential into the fleet.** The subscription token the shop issues for this
   fleet (`POST /ui/releases/entitlement`), the GitHub App's private key, a chat app's bot token,
   Google's Connect, a vault login (also the one a manager asks for with `request_secret`, whose
   answer, `POST /ui/needs/<id>/secret`, only the app's secure form gives, once the value is in the
   vault) and the Tailscale auth key itself. Each is the owner's account,
   the owner's money and the owner's liability (RULES.md, "Access that the fleet already holds"),
   and the value would have to pass through a tool. So the owner does these in the app, and this
   server hands out only what the fleet already holds. The Tailscale key is the one it touches,
   and only as the path of a file it never opens.
2. **Finish a provider sign-in.** `sign_in_machine` starts it and `sign_in_code` carries the code,
   but the page in between is the provider's own, in the owner's own browser, under the terms on
   which Founderizer may host the unmodified runtime at all: each end user signs in through the
   vendor's flow, and the operator never collects or intermediates the credential. The agent gives
   the owner the link and waits for the code.
3. **Be the owner on another machine.** The authority *is* the owner's Mac. An agent that runs in
   the cloud, on a worker or on anyone else's computer gets 403 from every owner route, and no
   argument to any tool changes that. The claim can only be made from the Mac that will own the
   fleet, so this server cannot grant itself the fleet from somewhere else — which is the point.

Two smaller ones worth knowing: a server has to exist and be paid for before `install_hub` can
reach it, and turning a new agent on waits for that machine's own setup check — the hub refuses
`activate_agent` until then and says exactly what is missing, which the agent can read and act on.

## Keeping it in step with the hub

This server is a client of the owner API, and the hub is built by several threads at once. So the one thing that
can go wrong is **drift**: the hub grows a route, a field or a value, and this file does not. It cannot be caught by
reading the file, because the failure is silent in three different ways, and each has a check of its own.

`owner_mcp.py` runs on the owner's Mac with the standard library alone, and the hub is on another machine, so it
**cannot import one name from the hub**. It repeats the routes, the fields and the enums as text. Two constants in
the file are where that repetition lives — `NOT_TOOLS` (the routes left out, each with its reason) and
`FROM_THE_HUB` (every value copied from `hub.py` or `lifecycle.py`) — and the checks below hold both to the hub.

| What drifts | How it fails if nothing checks | The check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A **new owner route** | The owner asks for it, the agent has no tool, and nobody knows the route exists | Every `ui_command` route of `hub.py` must be a tool here or named in `NOT_TOOLS` |
| A **new field** on a route that is already a tool | The worst one: `plain` and `with_base` send exactly the fields their own tuple names, so the call still succeeds and the setting is simply **not there** | Every field a route takes must be sendable by one of its tools |
| A **new value** of an enum | The agent is told the old values and refuses a good one, or sends a stale one | Every entry of `FROM_THE_HUB` must equal the hub's own constant |
| A **tool nobody wrote down** | The owner never learns he has it, and the table below goes stale both ways | Every tool must be named in this file, and every tool the table names must exist |

**All of them run in `selftest.py`**, section 0, from the source alone — no hub, no network, nothing started. That is
the point: `selftest.py` is what a release runs, and nothing excuses a failure in it (COORDINATION.md rule 5). So a
thread that adds an owner route or a field **fails the release** until it has decided whether the owner's own agent
can reach it. `test_owner_mcp.py` has the same drift checks with their reasoning. Neither keeps a list by hand: both read
`hub.py`.

The second check is not hypothetical. It found four powers on `POST /ui/team/agents/<a>` that `agent_settings`
**named in its own description** and could not send — `screen`, `runtime`, `vault` and `vault_create` — which are
now `agent_settings`'s `screen` field and the tools `switch_runtime`, `vault_access` and `login_creation`. The third
found `repo: read|write` after the hub had gained a third level, `deploy`.

Each check is proved to fail: a route, a field and an enum value were each added to a copy of `hub.py`,
and a tool was taken out of this file's own table, and every check failed naming exactly what drifted.

## Checks

`test_owner_mcp.py`, 43 checks, against a fixture hub and never against a real fleet:

- **`Boundary`** — OWNER-MCP-BOUNDARY.md, held to the code that enforces it: no agent can be put on
  the owner's address, no owner device can take a machine's address, the owner's own computer cannot
  join as a machine, `grant_access` does **not** refuse this server by name (asserted on purpose, so
  the address gate cannot be quietly replaced by a blocklist of one file name), and the grant it
  makes is inert — the dangerous tools, called from an address that names no owner, all refuse.
- **`McpServers`** — the owner's own MCP servers through this server: a `command` server checked
  against a machine before anything is saved, then saved, renamed and removed; an entry the hub
  refuses given back in the hub's own words with nothing saved; and an entry that moved under the
  command as the hub's own 409 instead of an overwrite.
- **`FromNothing`** — the whole claim, end to end, with a real MCP client over standard input and
  output, the real claim listener of `hubsetup.py`, the real owner API of `hub.py` in process and
  the real `POST /join` for the machine that joins: claim a hub, read the fleet, add a machine,
  put an agent on it with its install job, and then read every page of the owner API. Also a goal
  said in chat, a Needs-you item answered, access granted and taken back with every other hold
  left as it stands, the pool's standing, and a copy of the fleet written to this Mac and checked.
- **`Install`** — the install's commands in the order `INSTALL-PROMPT.md` gives them, with a
  stand-in `ssh` that answers from a table, because no test provisions a server: the auth key on
  standard input exactly once and in no argument, a key file other users can read refused before
  any command, a host or user that would not be one argument refused, the claim code read out of
  the log, and an install that stopped given to the owner instead of worked around.
- **`Refusals`** — a Mac that is not the owner's, a generation that moved, a `team.json` that
  moved under a command, the same `request_id` twice, and a field the hub refuses.
- **`NoSecret`** — no tool takes a secret, the credential-carrying routes are not tools here, a
  registered login in a message is refused and stored nowhere, and the sign-in code is in no row
  and no log line.
- **`Admin`** — the admin actions beside the ones `FromNothing` walks: a profile written as the owner and the
  agent's own notes read but never written; the reporting lines, so a worker reports to a lead; the entries of
  `team.json` (an account, a login's title, how a machine is reached) and one of the owner's own knowledge files
  added and removed; a person added with a handle, blocked and removed; a file sent to the hub, read back whole and
  kept; and the small switches — Pause all, the manager session, and a reload the hub refuses.
- **`Shape`** — an MCP client lists the tools, every page is a `GET` route `hub.py` really serves, and without a hub
  every tool says how to get one. And the three drift checks of "Keeping it in step with the hub" above, which are
  what answers "does it have all the admin actions" and keeps answering it: every owner route is a tool or is in
  `NOT_TOOLS` with its reason, every field of a route can be sent, and every value in `FROM_THE_HUB` is the hub's
  own. All three read `hub.py` and keep no list by hand, and all three also run in `selftest.py`, which a release
  runs.

**Live, 20 October 2026,** against a real fleet's own hub from its owner's Mac, with a real MCP client over standard input and output. `which_hub` said
`reads_owner_api: true`. Every read answered with his own fleet: four machines, each agent's
repositories, the people, the chat apps, capacity, health (`ok: true`), the checks, the duties, his
phone and the four profiles. `check_mcp_server` asked `mac-studio` about a program and **his Studio
answered for itself** (`missing`, "no notes-mcp on its PATH or in ~/.local/bin"), so the machine half
of that check is live on his fleet, which UI-API.md still calls not deployed. Three writes were made
and each was undone: an MCP server added (`f053582`) and removed (`bb07f77`); Pause all on and off
again; and a knowledge file added (`b2f3e8b`) and removed (`fb208c7`). His catalog, his Pause all and
his knowledge files are exactly as they were, and nothing else on his fleet was changed.

**Not proved:** no Linux server was provisioned and no provider was signed in to, so the install's
`apt`, `git clone`, `hub.sh` and `verify` steps are proved as the commands the server sends and
not as a real install; and the claim is proved against `hubsetup.py`'s own listener on loopback,
not over a tailnet.

It adds no route to `hub.py`, no table, no feature name and no change to `team.json`, so it needs
no deployment: it is one file on the owner's Mac.
