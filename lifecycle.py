"""Machine status reports and idle-only Fleet updates for one helper (owner API 1.2).

The helper reports what its machine runs and how it is protected, using only commands that need
no root. It updates its own Fleet checkout only when it has no task session: a fast-forward to the
hub's revision, then a restart of its own service. A failed step is reported; nothing is forced.
While an update runs, no task or chat session can start (see session_start).

It also updates the agent runtimes of its OS user, at most every six hours and only while no session of that user
works: the vendor's own update, a check of the new version, and the previous version back when the check fails
(update_runtimes).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the runtimes
#
# What the fleet knows about a runtime is here, in one entry for each provider, and nowhere else. hub.py, fleet.py and
# both installers import this module, so a fact written here once is the fact the whole fleet acts on, and a new
# provider is an entry and not a lane. The owner's words, 20 October 2026: "the idea is to support many different
# providers".
#
# Every field is named for what it MEANS and not for who has it, so a check that reads one says what it is really
# asking. A field the fleet writes nothing for is None, which is a fact of its own: a runtime with no manager_access
# cannot be the manager, a runtime with no sign_in is one the owner signs in to themselves.
#
#   label             what the owner is shown, never the key
#   driver            "terminal" (a CLI in a tmux window) or "acp" (Agent Client Protocol, through acp_runner.py)
#   acp_command       the agent command of an acp runtime, when team.json "start" gives none
#   can               the kinds of work its sessions do, where the fleet writes a set; None when it writes none, and
#                     then no agent can be switched to it (hub.switch_offer)
#   full_access       Fleet's full-access form of a worker or a lead, {start, allow}; None when Fleet writes none.
#                     Full access is no runtime limit on files, commands or the network and no permission prompt.
#                     Fleet's own deny rules still apply to every Claude session, and Claude's bypassPermissions is
#                     not the form used for it, because that shows a prompt at start unless the user turned it off.
#                     The separately opted-in app_server_pair has different permissions.
#   manager_access    the form a manager of this runtime starts with, {start}; None when it cannot be the manager.
#                     The owner's correction of 13 October 2026: Claude Code with every built-in tool and no
#                     permission check (its settings turn the start prompt off and add no Fleet deny rule), and
#                     Codex as its own full_access. A switch of the manager keeps this access both ways.
#   first_worker      the start the hub installer writes for the first worker of a fleet, which has no other worker to
#                     copy from (hubsetup.WORKER_STARTS), with the allow list of full_access; None when it writes none.
#                     It is the full-access form (the owner, 26 October 2026: workers act without asking), with the
#                     browser's place kept for a browser task
#   manager           its standing session continues its own conversation, so a manager can run on it
#   owner_chat        the owner can talk to an agent of this runtime in that agent's own chat window
#   agent_messages    its agents send and answer agent messages
#   conversation      its session can be locked down to the conversation tools of another person (C-<id>)
#   conversation_why  why it cannot be, in the words that person reads; None when it can
#   closed_versions   the versions of it that passed the lockdown test (test_conversation_lockdown's LiveProof and
#                     Pinned), the default first: with contacts.v2 a closed conversation runs at one of them and at
#                     no other, at the first unless the owner chose another (AUTONOMY.md P10, decision 35). A version
#                     joins only in a release whose lockdown test passed; () where none did
#   mcp_servers       its task sessions load the owner's MCP servers and the catalog tools
#   app_server        the fleet drives it over its own app-server protocol: screen tasks, and the app-server start
#                     policy of a worker or a lead (screen_runner.py)
#   switch            the owner can switch an agent to it and from it (owner feature runtime_switch)
#   session_settings  Fleet writes the session's permissions, deny rules and hooks as a settings argument
#                     (fleet.settings_arg)
#   token_in_env      its session reads the session credential from the environment; a runtime without it takes that
#                     credential in its MCP configuration instead (owner API 1.12)
#   model_flags       how a model and an effort reach a new session, as this runtime's own flags; None for one that
#                     takes neither
#   local_model       the start-command flag by which it runs a model on the machine itself; None when it has none
#   sign_in           the sign-in the fleet drives for it, or None: {args, after the executable; url, the provider's
#                     own link as it is read from the screen, and the hub takes the machine's word for it only when
#                     the whole link matches this; its length allows for the scopes and the challenge a provider
#                     puts in one (Claude Code's ran to 465 characters on 21 October 2026, and 400 refused it);
#                     shows_code, the code the provider prints, or None;
#                     wants_code, it waits for a code the owner pastes; setup_cursor, how a first-run question of
#                     its own shows that it is waiting on a choice, or None for a runtime that asks none}
#   sign_out          the sign-out the fleet drives for it, or None: {args, after the executable}. It exists for one
#                     reason: a provider will not start a second sign-in while one is live, so an owner who wants a
#                     DIFFERENT account of the same provider needs this half first (hub.start_machine_login, replace)
#   no_sign_in        why the fleet drives none, in the words the owner reads ({where}: this machine or that one);
#                     None when it drives one
#   sandbox           how its start command says what it may touch, as the owner reads it; None when Fleet cannot
#                     read it
#   screen_counter    a running turn of its terminal session repaints an elapsed counter every second, read live on
#                     the fleet's machines, so the screen watch takes a running screen that stopped changing for a
#                     frozen runtime (fleet.Helper.watch_screens, plan C2); False where nobody has read it
#   cache_seconds     how long the provider keeps a session's prompt cache after its last model call, as far as
#                     the fleet knows; a session told of a message later than that reads its whole context again at
#                     the price of writing it (plan P9.10, session_reuse). A session's own records can say less (a
#                     Claude session on a five-minute cache). None where the fleet knows nothing
#   compact_tokens    the context at which a session of it compacts its conversation as Fleet starts it; the reuse
#                     rule leaves room before it. None where the fleet knows nothing
#   routine           the model and effort of routine work on it, {model, effort}, None for the runtime's own
#                     default model: what an agent's one changer reaches for first (plan P9.7, P8)
#   task_denied       the built-in tools that the owner took away from its task sessions, which their settings deny
#                     (AUTONOMY.md decision 36, helper feature task_denied): every other tool stays, also a tool that a
#                     later version adds or renames; None where it has none of them
#   task_opening      how a task session that opens with its stable text first (helper feature stable_start, plan
#                     P9.2) gets its task: "read", in its first read_messages answer, because the rules and the
#                     profile are its appended system prompt; "prompt", at the end of its first prompt, because it
#                     reads RULES.md as its folder's AGENTS.md; None where Fleet starts none so
#   token_weights     its list prices in dollars per million tokens, {model key: {input, cache_read, cache_write,
#                     output}}, so that the cost of a session compares across providers (AUTONOMY.md P8, P10); on a
#                     subscription account they are weights, not money spent. A session's model takes the entry
#                     whose key is the longest part of its name, else "default". The owner's own prices are in
#                     team.json runtime_facts (facts_now); None for no prices
#
# What is NOT here, because it is code and not a fact: how a runtime's records become a transcript (threads.py), how
# its allowance is read (usage.py), what its own installer is (onboard.py), and how its sign-in window is driven to
# the end (fleet.do_signin). A fourth provider needs real work in each of those.
