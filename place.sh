# Founderizer target host setup (owner feature target_servers). The hub serves it at GET /place with its own address
# in HUB. The owner runs it as root on the host that holds a target, with the one line from Founderizer (Targets, Add
# server); FLEET_PLACE holds the one-time code.
#
# A key in a machine's vault reaches the place where an application reads it through one helper on this host,
# place.py, which the vault may run as the forced command of one SSH key and in no other way. This puts that helper
# here, gives the vault's key the one line of this host's authorized_keys file that runs it, and tells the hub this
# host's own public key, so the vault knows which host it is talking to. Those three were a page of pasted root
# commands, and the host key was typed into the app by hand.
#
# Nothing of a secret comes near this script. The code opens this one host's setup, the hub answers with the line and
# the checksum of the helper, and the value of a key never leaves the vault: it travels on the vault's own SSH
# connection to the helper this installs, and never through the hub or this script.
#
# Safe to run again, and run again is how a host is brought up to date: the script replaces its own line instead of
# adding a second one, so a second target on this host needs a new line from Founderizer and nothing else.
