# Founderizer hub installer. One line turns a fresh server into a working Founderizer hub: the one the Mac app and the iPhone app
# connect to, and the one every worker and joined server then fetches its code from.
#
#   A VPS (Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04, or Debian 12), as root, from a copy of the Founderizer repository on that server:
#
#       sh hub.sh                           the install
#       sh hub.sh --source <git url>        clone the Founderizer repository first, then install from that clone
#       sh hub.sh --check                   say what it would do, change nothing
#
# Its steps: base packages, the user fleet with lingering, the private network (Tailscale), the firewall, the bare
# repository and the hub's checkout on the configuration ref, the first team.json with the owner's own Mac proved by
# a one-time code, the root helper that makes an agent's OS user, one OS user for each agent of this machine,
# the fleet-hub and fleet-git user services, each agent of this machine under its own OS user (its checkout,
# its runtime and its service), the end checks, this fleet's own id, security updates, and verify.
#
# Each agent's session runs as its own user, `fleet-<agent>`, so its checkout, its runtime, that runtime's
# credential and its vault token are in a home of mode 700 that no other agent of this machine can open
# (PRODUCT.md 4.1).
#
# The last step is `python3 fleet.py verify` (PRODUCT.md 4.1), whose lines this installer prints: an install that
# half worked says which check failed and how to fix it, instead of looking finished. The line ends with a failure
# when a check failed, so the agent or the app that ran it knows.
#
# The Tailscale auth key comes on standard input, never in an argument or a URL: it goes to a file that only root can
# read, and `tailscale up --auth-key=file:<path>` reads it from there. The claim code is made on this machine and
# never leaves it as text; the owner's Mac sends it back, and the address of that call becomes addresses.owner.
#
# It is safe to run again: every step checks first, nothing is destroyed, and a second run on a working hub changes
# nothing. A step that failed can be repeated by running the line again.
#
# IT TOUCHES NO MODEL PROVIDER CREDENTIAL. It installs the runtime and signs in to nothing: it never signs in to a
# provider, never writes, copies or refreshes a provider token, and makes no vault entry. It never touches that login.
# The owner signs in to their own account afterwards, from the app (UI-API.md, "Sign a machine in"): the app gives
# them the provider's own link, they authenticate in their own browser, and the code they get back is typed into the
# sign-in running on this server, which is where the provider's client writes the credential. That is the condition on
# which Anthropic permits an operator to host the unmodified binary, and it is what makes this install lawful to sell.
