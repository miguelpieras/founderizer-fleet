#!/bin/sh
# Founderizer join script (owner feature servers). The hub serves it at GET /join with its own address in HUB and REPO. The
# owner runs it with the one line from Founderizer (Servers, Add server); FLEET_JOIN holds the one-time join code.
#
#   A VPS (Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04, or Debian 12), as root: base packages, the user fleet, then the join, security
#   updates and the firewall. The line has joined the private network (Tailscale) before this script.
#   A Mac (macOS 14 or later, with Tailscale and Homebrew), as the user that will run the agents: tmux and Python
#   with Homebrew, then the join, then this Mac's vault, the one step that asks for that user's password, then
#   Claude's extension for Chrome. The Founderizer installer runs the same line as root behind macOS's own password
#   dialog, with that user in FLEET_MAC_USER: each step of that user still runs as that user, and the vault asks nothing.
#
# The join itself is server.py in a new checkout of the Founderizer repository: the server key, POST /join with the code, and
# the server service. The code goes to server.py on standard input, never in a command argument or a URL. The script
# is safe to run again: each step checks first, and the hub knows the same server again by its address and key.
#
# Then, on Linux, the root helper that makes an agent's OS user and one OS user for each agent this machine already
# has: each agent's session runs as its own user, so its checkout, its runtime, that runtime's credential and its
# vault token are in a home of mode 700 that no other agent can open (PRODUCT.md 4.1). The agents the owner adds
# later are installed under their own users by the server service, which has no root and uses that helper. The last
# step is
# `python3 fleet.py verify` (PRODUCT.md 4.1), whose lines this script prints: a join that half worked says which
# check failed and how to fix it, instead of looking finished. The line ends with a failure when a check failed.
