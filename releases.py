"""The release channel: how a Founderizer fleet takes a new revision, and how it keeps the old one when the new one
is bad. PRODUCT.md 4.2 and 4.3, package P6.

The fleet already moves between revisions: its configuration lives on the branch `config`, the hub commits the
owner's own changes there, and code arrives by a merge (COORDINATION.md "The configuration ref"). This module adds
the three things that a customer's machine needs and the owner's own fleet never had: where the code comes from
(the git remote `upstream`), which revision is released (a signed manifest), and the safety that a bad release
costs nothing.

    manifest = check(raw, key)                      a manifest we may act on, or Untrusted
    Update(kit, manifest, origin=url).apply()       the update, with its own roll-back

**The signature is the whole trust.** A manifest that no public key in the repository verifies is not read, not
recorded and not applied. The private keys live only on the website (PRODUCT.md 4.2), so a hub can check a release
and can never make one. The key file holds a set, so a key can be replaced without stranding a fleet that skipped
the release which brought the new one (4.3, "How a signing key is replaced").

**Nothing happens in the hub's own checkout until every check passed.** The merge, the released code's schema
against a copy of this fleet's own database, `selftest.py` and `fleet.py verify` all run in a temporary clone,
exactly as `hub.commit_kit_file` commits the owner's files. So the pinned revision is not a revision the fleet
goes back to: it is the revision the fleet never left. A broken release costs the time it took to find out, and
nothing else.

The schema check is there because the other two cannot see it: both start hubs on *fresh* databases, so a
migration step that only the customer's own rows refuse passes them and meets real data for the first time at the
restart, after the ref has moved. `Update.schema_check` says the rest.

**The `hold` flag is the stop button.** The manifest can say that no fleet should take this release, whatever a
fleet's own settings say. It is signed with everything else, so it cannot be stripped on the way.

**The entitlement is carried, never enforced.** The hub sends it as a bearer to the channel and keeps what comes
back. Nothing here refuses work when it expires; only our side refuses (PRODUCT.md 4.2).

No dependency: a hub is a bare Ubuntu server with python3, git and curl (hub.sh PACKAGES), so the Ed25519
verification below is the reference implementation of RFC 8032 and nothing else.

        run" could come apart, so the sameness is proved and not argued.** The second merge is compared with the

        a profile or the owner's knowledge and refuses every other path (`hub.CONFIG_FILES`), and this merge takes
        those paths from the base and never from the release, so such a commit changes nothing the checks read.
        Those files themselves are not re-checked and do not need to be: the fleet already runs them. The hub
        committed them and moved its own checkout onto them before this run reached the push, so they are in force
        whether this release is taken or not.

        Anything else that reached the ref — code, a task's output, a commit made by hand — is a different tree
        from the one that passed. Then this run pushes nothing: it rolls back to the pinned revision and names the
