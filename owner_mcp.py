"""The owner's own MCP server: the third face of Founderizer, beside the Mac app and INSTALL-PROMPT.md.

    python3 owner_mcp.py              one MCP server on standard input and output, for the owner's own agent

The owner gives this server to an agent he already runs (his Claude, or any MCP client). The agent then sets a fleet
up and runs it the way the app does: it installs a hub, claims it, adds machines and agents, adds MCP servers, hands
out access from the pool, sets a goal, reads every check, takes releases and backups, and answers a Needs-you item.
OWNER-MCP.md says how the owner gives it and what it cannot do without him, and OWNER-MCP-BOUNDARY.md says what
stops it becoming a tool the manager can grant to an agent.

**It is a client of the owner API, not a second one.** Every tool here is one route of `hub.py`'s owner API, with
that route's own body, its own refusals and its own command rules: a `request_id` of its own, the hub's generation
(`db`), and `base_sha256` where the command moves `team.json`. This file validates nothing that the hub validates:
it passes the fields through and gives the hub's own words back, so the two can never drift apart. It validates
only what no hub sees — the SSH host and user it puts in a command line, and the mode of the Tailscale key file.

**Its authority is the owner's Mac, granted once.** `hub.py` `ui_allowed` knows the owner by the address the call
comes from (`addresses.owner` in `team.json`, which the install's claim proved) and refuses a bearer token on those
routes. So this server holds no credential at all: it runs on the owner's Mac and inherits that Mac's identity.
There is no second credential path, nothing to store and nothing to revoke but the Mac itself. After the owner has
put the server in his agent's MCP configuration, it acts without asking again, because the grant is the
authorization (RULES.md, "Access that the fleet already holds").

**No secret passes through a tool**, in or out: no password, no API key, no provider token, no entitlement, no
Tailscale key. The Tailscale auth key is named by the path of a file that only the owner can read, exactly as
INSTALL-PROMPT.md asks, and it travels on standard input into the server. The only text of that kind this server
carries is a one-time code that dies in minutes — a claim code, a join line, a provider's device code — which
RULES.md allows as plain text and the hub keeps only as a SHA-256.

Standard library only, as `mcp.py` and `hubsetup.py` are. Tests: `test_owner_mcp.py`, against a fixture hub.
